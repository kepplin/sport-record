## To do:

1. make responsive
2. cricket record (?)

bugs:

- sort feature is buggy when trying to sort winrate

Features:

- select date period
- when clicking on a players name highlight matches theyve played in
- player picker button, example select players and it goes through the table to see if selected players have been in a team together before, and if so how many times theyve won
- click on a players name to get more info on them, opens up a menu which shows all the data but specific to them, for instance every match theyve played with, graphs for their WR over time.
- win predictor for teams?
- winstreak/losestreak
